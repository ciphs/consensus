# CIPHS Cryptocurrency
MAIN PROPOSAL

First Proposal as on 15 Jan 2018:
Ciphs coin creation based on ERC20/ERC23 token. 
1. Initial Supply Issuance: 7,000,000 Ciphs
- 5,000,000 Ciphs prior for platform launching,
- 1,000,000 Ciphs for contributor bounty
- 1,000,000 Ciphs for Ciphs.org development
2. Max Ciphs Supply: 860,000,000,000
3. Decimal: 18 integer
4. Mineable: No, Total Supply will be release from Ciphs wallet using voting system.
5. Burnable: Yes, can be extend to get other coin.
6. Owner: Ciphs.org (Ciphs Consensus)
7. To ensure Ciphs diversity in usage and purpose, we highlight some few guidelines:
- Ciphs is ERC20/ERC23 compliance (as propose by @dexaran on [EIP223](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223))
- Ciphs can be adapt by other smart contract and also by DAO.
- Ciphs Consensus can be form with 5 different addresses (must stake at least 10 Ciphs within wallet in order to vote in Consensus) with 1 address 1 vote.
- Proposal can be present by DAO or single entity. Any proposal must at least achieve 70% agreement to deploy.
- Additional Coin supply release depending on Ciphs Consensus and voting system to avoid inflation.
- Ciphs code must be clean and minify to ensure low gas/fee usage. Submission to EtherDelta, Code verification and upload it on Ciphs Github is compulsory.
- Ciphs code must align with major exchange standard code and will not cause bug to their service (yobit, bittrex and such) to be accepted by them. Must understandable by other developer to continue extend the code.
- Ciphs is not limited for payment purpose. Ciphs can be use as voting right, in-game reward, staking reward, smart contract funding, trading and not limited to these usage. The people of Ciphs can determine the future path of the currency they use.
- Safe, Secure and Working coin with pricing pair on mobile wallet such as imToken or Coinomi.
